# openclaw-claude-bridge

A bridge between [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) and
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) that gives you a single
daily-driver command — `cc` — for running Claude Code with:

- A unified `CLAUDE.md` auto-generated from your OpenClaw workspace
- Claude Code's experimental **Agent Teams** mode turned on
- Dedicated, Mosh-friendly tmux sessions with 100k scrollback and
  working mouse wheel
- Support for multiple parallel sessions (`cc new`) so you can run
  independent workflows side-by-side in different terminals
- Role presets for spawning research / full-stack / debug teams in one
  paste
- Cockpit-style status bar and layout shortcuts

It runs on an isolated tmux socket (`-L cc`), so it never touches your
personal tmux configuration or collides with other sessions you have
running.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mister-bernard/openclaw-claude-bridge
cd openclaw-claude-bridge
bash install.sh
```

The installer drops a handful of files and leaves the rest of your
machine alone:

| Path                                          | What it is                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `~/.local/bin/cc`                             | The `cc` daily-driver wrapper       |
| `~/.openclaw/bridge/tmux.conf`                | Mosh-friendly tmux config for `cc`  |
| `~/.openclaw/bridge/lib/bridge.sh`            | CLAUDE.md synthesizer               |
| `~/.openclaw/bridge/presets/*.md`             | Role preset prompts                 |
| `~/.claude/settings.json`                     | Claude Code config (backed up)      |
| `~/CLAUDE.md`                                 | Synthesized workspace (backed up)   |

A cron job is registered to re-sync `~/CLAUDE.md` every 30 minutes. Make
sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`; the installer will tell you if it
isn't.

## Prereqs

- `tmux` 3.0+
- `claude` CLI ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)) on `PATH`
- An OpenClaw workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace/` containing:
  `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`
  (override with `OC_WORKSPACE=...`)

**Don't have a workspace yet?** The installer will notice and offer to set
one up for you:

1. **Bernard Bootstrap** (recommended) — clones
   [`mister-bernard/bernard-bootstrap`](https://github.com/mister-bernard/bernard-bootstrap)
   and runs its `setup.sh`. You get battle-tested templates for identity,
   soul, agents, and tools, plus an operational playbook. Customize from
   there.
2. **Default OpenClaw** — runs `npm install -g openclaw` and drops in blank
   placeholder files. Fastest path if you want to write everything
   yourself.
3. **Abort** — set up the workspace by hand and re-run `install.sh`.

For non-interactive installs (CI, `curl | bash`), set `OC_BOOTSTRAP` to
pin the choice: `bernard`, `default`, or `skip`. The default on a
non-TTY stdin is `bernard`.

## Daily use

```bash
cc                      # start or attach the default 'main' session
cc new                  # start another parallel session (auto-named main-2, …)
cc new deploy           # …or with an explicit name
cc ls                   # list all cc sessions + accounts
cc attach main-2        # attach to a specific session
cc sync                 # regenerate ~/CLAUDE.md from the workspace
cc status               # show session and workspace state (all sessions)
cc roles                # list available role presets
cc preset full-stack    # print the full-stack preset prompt (paste into lead)
cc use B                # set the global default account (see Accounts)
cc -a B                 # start main on a specific account (one-off)
cc new -a B deploy      # start a named parallel session on account B
cc kill                 # kill the default session (with confirmation)
cc kill main-2          # …or kill a specific session
cc help                 # full usage
```

### Accounts

`cc` can launch Claude Code against one of several accounts defined in
`~/.tokenburn.json` — the same file the [`tb`](https://github.com/mister-bernard/tools/tree/main/tb)
dashboard reads. One account is the global default (`active_account`);
any other account can be picked per-launch with `-a <id>`.

Each account entry looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "B",
  "name": "Assistant (messaging/email)",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "claude_bin": "/home/you/.local/bin/claude-b",
  "usage_profile": "backup"
}
```

- `claude_bin` — the launcher this account uses (often a wrapper that
  sets `HOME` to a separate `.claude/` directory so OAuth tokens don't
  collide). Accounts without a `claude_bin` (e.g. API-only providers)
  are listed in `cc ls` but can't be launched as a tmux session.
- `provider` — free-form label; used by companion tooling to gate
  provider-specific behavior (e.g. rotation policies).
- `usage_profile` — key into `~/.anthropic-usage/usage-clean.json`;
  `cc ls` surfaces each account's live 5h/7d usage percentages from
  that file when available.

**Switching is manual.** `cc use B` writes the new `active_account` to
`~/.tokenburn.json` (delegating to `~/scripts/cc-switch.sh` if present,
which also handles bridge rotation). `cc -a B` / `cc new -a B` launches
a one-off session without flipping the global default — useful when
you want to briefly hop accounts for a single tmux session.

> **Anthropic ToS note:** rotating between multiple Anthropic accounts
> to circumvent usage limits is not permitted. Keep account switching
> manual and purpose-driven (e.g. one account for development, another
> for personal-assistant automations). Rotation tooling for other
> providers whose terms permit it is out of scope for this repo.

### Favorites

`cc fav add <key> <name> [workdir] [claude-bin]` registers a named
shortcut you can launch with `cc <key>` (e.g. `cc gc` for Giant Cedar).
Favorites live in `~/.cc-favorites.json`. Each favorite can also carry
a `color` field (`green`, `yellow`, `red`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `orange`,
`blue`, or a literal `#hex`) — `cc <key>` then paints the tmux window
name, pane-active border, and status-left accent in that color so it's
obvious which context you're in at a glance.

```json
{
  "gc": { "name": "Giant Cedar", "workdir": "~/giant-cedar",
          "claude_bin": "claude", "color": "green" },
  "pv": { "name": "PV Fund",     "workdir": "~/projects/pv-fund",
          "claude_bin": "claude", "color": "yellow" }
}
```

### Parallel sessions

`cc new` lets you run independent workflows side-by-side without them
stepping on each other. Open a second terminal tab, run `cc new`, and
you get a fresh lead in its own tmux session — one for the thing you're
hacking on, another for a long-running research pass, another for ops.
Each session is independent: own context, own pane layout, own team
roster.

```bash
# tab 1
cc                      # main: working on the feature branch

# tab 2
cc new docs             # docs: long-running docs rewrite
cc new                  # or auto-named main-2 if you don't care

# any tab
cc ls                   # see what's running, which is attached
cc attach main          # jump back to main from anywhere
```

All parallel sessions share the isolated `cc` tmux socket, so they stay
out of your personal tmux sessions. `cc ls` and `cc status` show the
full roster; `cc kill <name>` takes them down one at a time.

### Default layout: 5 vertical panes

A new `cc` session opens as **5 vertical columns**, each running `claude`
on the chosen account. The leftmost pane is the lead (titled `lead[A]`,
`lead[B]`, …); the others are peer workers (`p2[A]`, `p3[A]`, …) you can
hand independent jobs without burning context in the lead. Override with
`CC_PANES=N` (1–9):

```bash
CC_PANES=1 cc          # classic single-pane lead
CC_PANES=3 cc new -a B # 3-pane session on account B
```

Inside the session (prefix = `Ctrl-b`):

| Keys                 | What it does                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-b B`           | Horizontal bars layout (stacked top-to-bottom) |
| `Ctrl-b H`           | Vertical columns layout (default)            |
| `Ctrl-b T`           | Tiled layout                                 |
| Mouse wheel          | Scroll back (100k lines)                     |
| `Shift+PageUp/Down`  | Keyboard scrollback                          |
| `Alt+Arrow`          | Jump between panes                           |
| `Ctrl-b r`           | Reload tmux config                           |
| `Ctrl-b d`           | Detach — session keeps running               |

## Agent Teams: the lead-spawns-teammates model

Agent Teams is **not** six peer sessions. It's **one lead + N teammates**.
You start a single `claude` process (that's the lead) and ask it in plain
English to spawn teammates. Claude Code itself creates the new tmux panes
and manages the roster. The panes coordinate through a shared task list
and a `SendMessage` tool — you talk to the lead, and the lead routes.

```
You: create a team with 4 teammates in split-pane tmux mode.
     roles: backend, frontend, tests, ops.
     assign non-overlapping file ownership so they don't clobber each other.
```

Or skip the typing and use a preset:

```bash
cc preset full-stack    # prints the prompt
# copy, paste into the lead
```

### Role presets

| Preset       | Teammates | Use case                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `research`   | 3         | researcher + fact-checker + writer    |
| `full-stack` | 4         | backend + frontend + tests + ops      |
| `debug`      | 3         | reproducer + fixer + verifier         |
| `solo`       | 0         | no team, just the lead                |

Each preset enforces strict, non-overlapping file ownership — Agent Teams
has no file locking, so two teammates editing the same file silently
clobber each other. Splitting ownership by directory is the cheapest way
to prevent that.

### Sweet spot

The docs call **3–5 teammates** the sweet spot. Beyond that:

- Token cost scales linearly (each teammate has its own context window)
- Coordination overhead starts dominating
- File conflict surface grows quadratically

Six is the upper bound that still feels useful. Start with four, measure,
add more only if the workstreams are genuinely independent.

## Mosh + scrollback

Mosh has no scrollback of its own — it replaces your terminal's buffer
with its own screen. **Tmux is the scrollback** when you're over Mosh.

The tmux config shipped here does three things that matter for Mosh:

1. **`set -g history-limit 100000`** — 100k lines per pane
2. **`set -g mouse on`** with smooth wheel → copy-mode handoff
3. **`set -s escape-time 0`** — no ESC key lag (Mosh amplifies even a few ms)

If the wheel isn't scrolling inside a Claude Code pane, you're probably
not loading this config. Run `cc status` — if the session isn't labeled
`cc` on the `cc` socket, something else is attaching. Kill it and
re-`cc`.

Keyboard scrollback: `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown` works everywhere,
including inside Claude Code's TUI.

## Architecture

│  ├ IDENTITY.md │───▶│ reads ~/CLAUDE.md        │

  cc sync             └──────────────────────────┘
  (manual or cron)
```

`install.sh` is the one-time installer. `cc` is the daily driver.
`lib/bridge.sh` does the actual `CLAUDE.md` synthesis and is also what
the cron job invokes.

## Sync model

`~/CLAUDE.md` is regenerated from scratch every sync — no merge, no diff.
Edit the source files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and run `cc sync`. If
you edit `~/CLAUDE.md` directly, your changes will be overwritten on the
next sync (the previous version is saved as `~/CLAUDE.md.bak.<timestamp>`,
and the last 5 backups are kept).

The sync extracts specific sections from the workspace files:

- From `AGENTS.md`: everything between `# RULES` and `# DELEGATION`
- From `TOOLS.md`: everything between `## Key services` and `## Pending`
- `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`: full file (minus HTML comments)

If you use different section markers, edit `lib/bridge.sh`.

## Uninstall

```bash
# remove files
rm -f ~/.local/bin/cc ~/CLAUDE.md
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/bridge

# remove cron entry
crontab -l | grep -v "/.openclaw/bridge/lib/bridge.sh" | crontab -

# restore your old Claude Code settings if you want
ls ~/.claude/settings.json.bak.*   # pick one and mv it back
```

## Best practices

Once you're past install, read [`docs/best-practices.md`](docs/best-practices.md)
for a field guide to getting the most out of the `cc` + Claude Code +
Agent Teams setup: what belongs in `CLAUDE.md` (and what doesn't),
permission tuning, genuinely useful hook patterns, when Agent Teams
pays off and when it doesn't, tmux/mosh ergonomics, and context/cost
discipline.
